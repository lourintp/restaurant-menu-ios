The technical documentation can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZKXV9-zoByAQTksRGhK6lLc5qOhScPa-e9ujiZACeA/edit?usp=sharing).

The video about the app is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8KX_nkeQwn909kCyDpZwiRDQUbFoc0P/view?usp=sharing) and answers three questions:

1 - How does the software work?
2 - How did I build this project?
3 - Why did I build it this way?

To run the app, you need to have an API key from [documenu.com](https://documenu.com) and put the API key on the plist file or create a configuration file using the API_KEY variable like this:

API_KEY = your_api_key
